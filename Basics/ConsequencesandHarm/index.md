# Consequences & Harm
Enemy actions, bad circumstances, or the outcome of a roll can inflict **consequences** on a PC. There are five types:
* Reduced Effect
* Complication
* Lost Opportunity
* Worse Position
* Harm

A given circumstance might result in one or more consequences, depending on the situation. The GM determines the consequences, following from the fiction and the style and tone established by the game group.
