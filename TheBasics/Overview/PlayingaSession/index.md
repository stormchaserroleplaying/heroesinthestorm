# Playing A Session
So, what’s it like to play? A session of *Heroes in the Storm* is like an episode of a TV show. There are one or two main events, plus maybe some side-story elements, which all fit into an ongoing series. A session of play can last anywhere from two to six hours, depending on the preferences of the group.

During a session, the party of adventurers works together to choose a quest to accomplish (either by getting a job from an NPC or by creating their own goal), then they make a few dice rolls to jump into the action of the quest in progress. The PCs take actions, suffer consequences, and finish the quest (succeed or fail). Then the party has downtime, during which they recover, pursue side-projects, and indulge their vices. After downtime, the players once again look for a new opportunity or create their own goals and pursuits, and we play to find out what happens next.

A given game session is typically one quest and the following downtime, plus exploration and discovery of a new opportunity. As your group gets more familiar with the game, you might be able to pack more into a session, even doing two quests in an evening of play.
After a dozen sessions or so, you might decide to have a break in the flow of the story and start up a “season two” series, possibly with a slightly different cast of characters and a new starting situation.
