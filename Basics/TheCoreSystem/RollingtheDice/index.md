# Rolling The Dice
*Heroes in the Storm* uses four-sided dice. You roll several at once and read the **single highest result**.

* If the highest die is a **4**, it’s a **full success**; things go well. If you roll more than one **4**, it’s a **critical success** and you gain some additional advantage.
* If the highest die is a **3**, that’s a **partial success**. You do what you were trying to do, but there are consequences: trouble, harm, reduced effect, etc.
* If the highest die is a **2**, that's a **partial failure**. You don't manage to achieve your goal, but some beneficial factor mitigates the failure or provides you with a new opporunity.
* If the highest die is **1**, it’s a **critical failure**; things go poorly. You don't achieve your goal and you suffer complications, too.

*If you ever need to roll but you have zero (or negative) dice, roll two dice and take the single lowest result. You can’t roll a **critical** when you have zero dice.*

All the dice systems in the game are expressions of this basic format. When you're first learning the game, you can always "collapse" back down to a simple roll to judge how things go. Look up the exact rule later when you have time.

The most common result is **4**: full success. This means that your character will tend to succeed. *Heroes in the Storm* is a game about heroic characters on epic adventures. The dice mechanic reinforces this by making full success crop up again and again.

To create a dice pool for a roll, you'll use a **trait** (like your **Skulk** or your **Prowess** or your party’s Tier) and take dice equal to its **rating**. You'll usually end up with one to five dice. Even one die is pretty good in this game; a 50% chance of success. The most common traits you'll use are the **action ratings** of the player characters. A player might roll dice for their **Skirmish** action rating when they fight an enemy, for example.

There are four types of rolls that you'll use most often in the game:
* **Action Roll.** When a PC attempts an action that’s dangerous or troublesome, you make an action roll to find out how it goes. Action rolls and their effects and consequences drive most of the game.
* **Downtime Roll.** When the PCs are at their leisure after a job, they can perform downtime activities in relative safety. You make downtime rolls to see how much they get done.
* **Fortune Roll.** The GM can make a fortune roll to disclaim decision making and leave something up to chance. *How loyal is an NPC? How much does the plague spread? How much evidence is burned before the Bluecoats kick in the door?*
* **Resistance Roll.** A player can make a resistance roll when their character suffers a consequence they don’t like. The roll tells us how much stress their character suffers to reduce the severity of a consequence. *When you resist that “Broken Leg” harm, you take some stress and now it’s only a “Sprained Ankle” instead.*
