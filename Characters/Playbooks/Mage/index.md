# Mage
Mages include wizards, sorcerers, warlocks and all manner of arcane spellcasters.

## Special Abilities

### Arcane Barrage
You can tick your **ability clock** in order to **push** yourself to channel powerful offensive magic. This ability can manifest either as a focused attack, such as a beam or ray, or as a widespread attack like a blast of fire. Choose one of the following options:
* Your attack benefits from **potency** as you concentrate your magic on one target
* Your attack benefits from increased **scale**, allowing you to effect a small area or multiple enemies with one attack (up to 6 people).

### Defensive Wards
You may expend your **special armour** to resist a magical consequence or to push yourself when you contend with or employ arcane forces.

### Disjunction
When you encounter an ongoing magical effect or find yourself in the presence of a spell being cast, you may tick your **ability clock** to make a channel action roll anc attempt dispel the effect or counter the spell.

### Eldritch Pact
There are many nefarious entities that make their powers available to those willing to serve them. One such entity has gifted you with a small portion of its eldritch power - for a price.

By taking this special ability you gain an additional way to use a **Devil’s Bargain** in any situation and for any end. You do this by calling on your patron (an entity or power defined between the GM and yourself when you take this ability) to imbue you with their power. The consequences of these special **Devil’s Bargains** are always aligned with the desires and values of the entity that you formed the pact with, as determined by the GM.

### Familiar
You seal an extraplanar spirit inside the form of a **pet** that you own. Your pet is now considered magical. You can channel arcane effects through it as if you were standing in its place and you can see and hear through its eyes and ears, although you are blinded and deafened while you do this.

### Spellbook
You know the arcane methods to perform ritual sorcery. You can **study** an occult ritual (or create a new one) to summon a supernatural effect or being. You begin with one ritual already learned.

### Spellbound Strikes
You inscribe your melee weapons with arcane glyphs, imbuing them with sorcerous power. Your weapons are considered magical, and you gain **potency** when using them to attack mundane enemies.

The arcane power that suffuses a magical blade punches through armour that would turn away an edge of mundane steel. Armour with protective enchantments and creatures with supernatural resistance to mundane weapons cancel out this potency, as your arcane assault meets their arcane defense.

### Witch Sense
You can always see and feel the currents of magic around you. You benefit from *potency* whenever you gather information about the arcane.
