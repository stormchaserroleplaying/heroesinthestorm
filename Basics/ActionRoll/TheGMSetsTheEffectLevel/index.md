# 4. The GM Sets The Effect Level
The GM assesses the likely effect level of this action, given the factors of the situation. Essentially, the effect level tells us "how much" this action can accomplish: will it have limited, standard, or great effect? Effect level is explained in detail in the next section.

> *The GM's choices for effect level and position can be strongly influenced by the player's choice of action rating. If a player wants to try to make a new friend by **Wrecking** something, well... maybe that’s possible, but the GM wouldn't be crazy to say it’s a desperate roll and probably limited effect. Seems like **Consorting** would be a lot better for that. The players are always free to choose the action they perform, but that doesn't mean all actions should be equally risky or potent.*
