# Effect
In *Heroes in the Storm*, you achieve goals by taking actions and facing consequences. But how many actions does it take to achieve a particular goal? That depends on the effect level of your actions. The GM judges the effect level using the profiles below. Which one best matches the action at hand; great, standard, or limited? Each effect level indicates the questions that should be answered for that effect, as well as how many segments to tick if you’re using a progress clock.

| Effect | Description | Ticks |
|:--------------|:------------|:-----:|
| Great | You achieve more than usual. How does the extra effort manifest? What additional benefit do you enjoy? | 3 |
| Standard | You achieve what we’d expect as “normal” with this action. Is that enough, or is there more left to do? | 2 |
| Limited | You achieve a partial or weak effect. How is your impact diminished? What effort remains to achieve your goal? | 1 |
