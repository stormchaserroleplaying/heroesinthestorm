# 5. Add Bonus Dice
You can normally get two bonus dice for your action roll (some special abilities might give you additional bonus dice).

For one bonus die, you can get **assistance** from a teammate. They take 1 stress, say how they help you, and give you +1d. See **Teamwork**.

For another bonus die, you can either **push yourself** (take 2 stress) or you can accept a **Devil’s Bargain** (you can't get dice for both, it’s one or the other).

## The Devil's Bargain
PCs in **Heroes in the Storm** are heedless adventurers who often shoot first and ask questions later. They don't always act in their own best interests. To reflect this, the GM or any other player can offer you a bonus die if you accept a Devil's Bargain. Common Devil's Bargains are:

* Collateral damage, unintended harm.
* Sacrifice **coin** or an item.
* Betray a friend or loved one.
* Offend or anger a faction.
* Start and/or tick a troublesome clock.
* Add **trouble** to the party from evidence or witnesses.
* Suffer harm.

The Devil’s Bargain occurs regardless of the outcome of the roll. You make the deal, pay the price, and get the bonus die. There might not be an interesting Devil’s Bargain in every situation. If one doesn't occur to anyone right away, that’s fine.

> *"These mercenaries aren't the most trustworthy scum, so if we leave them alone with the coin, there's a good chance they'll bolt with it while we're gone. I'm gonna get all up in their faces and **Command** them to keep their dirty hands off."*
> 
> *"Oooh, I have a Devil’s Bargain. You can take +1d but they don't take well to threats. I'll start a new 4-clock called ‘Merc Revenge' and tick it three times. Push them around again you're going to have a second group to fight."*
> 
> *"Nice. I like it! Maybe I’ll try to un-tick some of that clock in downtime..."*

Some players like to get a little fancy or creative with Devil's Bargains, using them to re-write a bit of the situation, create something new in the flow of the narrative, or shine a spotlight on a character’s weaknesses.

> *"Someone here is a member of your old platoon. The one you left for dead."*
> 
> *"One of the cultists becomes obsessed with you."*
>
> *"The crates you're stealing have clear Guild markings. Your Guild friend is going to be miffed when she hears!"*

Don’t push these bargains too hard if the player doesn't like this kind of narrative sleight-of-hand. It’s fun for some and annoying for others.

The Devil’s Bargain is always a free choice. If you don't like one, just reject it (or suggest how to alter it so you might consider taking it). You can always just push yourself for that bonus die instead.

If it's ever needed, the GM has final say over which Devil’s Bargains are valid.
