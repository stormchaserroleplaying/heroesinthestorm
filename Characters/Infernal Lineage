When you successfully Command a creature of lesser tier, you may afflict them with Level 1 Harm - Cowed

People find you disarmingly alluring or amiable, and they readily bend to your wishes. You gain potency when you Consort & Sway by using deceitful or seductive words. Additionally, magic to determine if you are being truthful always indicates that you are telling the truth, and you cannot be magically compelled to tell the truth.

### Hellish Constitution

### Dark Contract
You carry an instinctual awareness of the methods to create a fiendish contract of the Nine Hells. You can Study to create an Infernal contract, binding a creature or being into service. You begin with one such contract already enacted.
You determine the terms of the contract. Contracts typically involve a service that the entity will perform for you, such as protecting your life or most valuable possessions or devotion to a concept or cause that you define. Make a Study roll, the result of which determines the function of the contract. Note: (If you roll 1 then you have to uphold your end of the bargain completely and they don’t completely fulfill theirs, if it’s a 2-3 then they fulfill theirs and you don’t have to fully hold up your end. If you roll a 4 then they must hold up their end but you don’t have to do anything for them. All is determined by how well your write the contract with fine print and loopholes.)
