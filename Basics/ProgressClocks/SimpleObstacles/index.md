# Simple Obstacles
Not every situation and obstacle requires a clock. Use clocks when a situation is complex or layered and you need to track something over time. Otherwise, resolve the result of an action with a single roll.

Examples of progress clocks follow. This is not an exhaustive list. Use them as you see fit!
