# The Characters
The adventurers attempt to develop their party from a ragtag group of poor independents to a serious and reputed heroes who have built a name for themselves, leaving their own unique mark on the world in the process. They do this by taking risky jobs, planning their own escapades, forging alliances and outsmarting their enemies. They'll gain the respect of the factions they help, and suffer the ire of the factions they get in the way of.

There are several character types to choose from:

* **Artificers** are tinkerers, alchemists and saboteurs.
* **Bards** are manipulators and spies.
* **Disciples** are mortals touched by the gods.
* **Mages** are arcane adepts.
* **Rangers** are deadly sharpshooters and trackers.
* **Rogues** are stealthy infiltrators.
* **Shamans** are spirit guides and druids. 
* **Warriors** are dangerous and intimidating fighters.

Character types aren't unique. You can mix and match, or play a party that is all of one type. It's up to you. For more, see **Character Creation**.
