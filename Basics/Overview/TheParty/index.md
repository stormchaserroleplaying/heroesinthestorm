# The Party
In addition to creating adventurer characters, you'll also create the party by choosing which type of quests you're interested in exploring. The party gets its own "character sheet", just like a player character.

* A **Cult** serves a higher power.
* **Defenders** protect a community or people.
* **Explorers** adventure to satisfy their curiosity.
* **Rebels** plot to overthrow an oppressor.
* **Slayers** are monster hunters for hire.
* **Villains** are evildoers with nefarious ends.

The party type isn't restrictive (you can pursue a variety of activities); itâ€™s there to help focus the gameplay.
