# Pushing Yourself
You can use stress to push yourself for greater performance. For each bonus you choose below, take **2 stress** (each can be chosen once for a given action):
* Add **+1d** to your roll. (This may be used for an action roll or downtime roll or any other kind of roll where extra effort would help you)
* Add **+1 level** to your effect.
* Take action when you’re incapacitated.

The ability to push yourself for +1d means you effectively have at least 1d in every action as long as you have stress to burn. Even 1d gives you a 50/50 chance of success. This is the core "hero's luck" in the game system. Even when you’re in a bad spot, trying to do something for which you have no experience or training, you can dig deep and give yourself a chance. *(A much better chance than rolling 2d and taking the lowest when you have zero dots.)*

It’s important to remember this! Some players tend to forget and dismiss actions for which they have zero dots. "Nah, I can’t do that. I don’t have Attune. I’d have to roll 2d and take the worst. Ugh."" As long as you have stress to burn, you can get 1d and give any action a decent shot.
