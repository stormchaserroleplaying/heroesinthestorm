# Infernal Lineage
Your lineage can be traced back to a powerful devil of hell, which has imbued you with unique and terrible abilities. An infernal heritage manifests differently for each individual, often influenced by the extent to which they revel in the patient and methodical evil that lies dormant in their blood.

## Special Abilities

### Blade of Phlegethos
You can manifest an obsidian blade that glows with an internal heat. This weapon can be summoned and dismissed at will, and you can tick your ability clock to cause it to produce a wave of flame.

### Brand of Damnation
You can tick your ability clock to touch a creature and mark them with an infernal sigil through which you can exert your influence. The sigil is temporary, but causes the target burning pain like a brand. For as long as the sigil can be maintained, the creature's actions are reduced in effect. If the marked creature dies while the brand remains, you clear stress equal to the creature's tier.

### Dark Contract
You have learned to scribe infernal contracts that bind a creature to your service. At the GM's discretion, you may begin play with one such contract already enacted.

You determine the terms of the contract. Contracts typically involve a service that the entity will perform for you, such as protecting your life or most valuable possessions or devotion to a concept or cause that you define.

To scribe an infernal contract make a Study action roll, the result of which determines the conditions of the contract, depending on how skillfully the fine print and loopholes of the contract are written.
* On a 1, you have to uphold your end of the bargain completely and the other party does not entirely fulfill theirs.
* On a 2, the contract is equitable and both parties must uphold their end of the bargain.
* On a 3, the other party must fulfill their obligation, but you must only partially keep your end of the deal.
* On a 4, the other party must fulfill their obligation, but you must not.

The process of writing such a contract takes at least 8 hours. More at the GM's discretion.

### Devil's Tongue
People find you disarmingly alluring or amiable, readily bending to your wishes. You have potency when you Consort or Sway using deceitful or seductive words. Additionally, your ability to circumlocute means that you suffer 1 less stress when resisting magic that compels you to speak the truth.

### Infernal Authority
Hell is governed by a strict hierarchy in which the weak submit to the strong. You can tick your ability clock to project this same air of superiority when interacting with lesser beings. While this aura is active, creatures of a lower tier than you recognise that you are not to be trifled with and are less inclined to cause you trouble. Additionally, when you Command a creature of lesser tier, they are cowed by the authority of your presence and submit to your wishes.

### Infernal Constitution
The circles of hell feature lakes of ice, poisonous fumes and rivers of fire, and your infernal blood has hardened your body against such conditions. You suffer 1 less stress when resisting the effects of cold, fire, or poison. However, harm that you receive from silver weapons has increased effect.
