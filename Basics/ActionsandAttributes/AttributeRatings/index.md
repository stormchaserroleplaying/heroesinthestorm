# Attribute Ratings
There are four attributes in the game system that the player characters use to resist bad consequences: **Acumen**, **Insight**, **Prowess**, and **Resolve**. Each attribute has a rating (from zero to four) that tells you how many dice to roll when you use that attribute.

The rating for each attribute is equal to the number of dots in the second column under that attribute. The more well-rounded your character is with a particular set of actions, the better their attribute rating.
