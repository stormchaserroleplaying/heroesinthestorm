# Making The Game Your Own
This game is about exciting adventures with adventurers in a fantasy world. Before you get too far into actually playing the game, you should have a talk with your table about what sort of themes you’d like to see in play. Not every game is for every group of players, and you need your potential party to buy into the conceit of the game.

Some of this is indirectly decided by what sorts of characters you make and what type of party you select. For example, if you want
themes of revolution, choose to play as rebels. However, you should be talking through your decisions so that everyone is on the same page about what you're trying to do. If someone is uncomfortable with a direction, negotiate with each other to ensure everyone has fun.

This book is a distillation of best practices and useful elements. It’s one leg of the tripod that forms the basis for successful play: The book, your group, and the online community. Roleplaying is, at its essence, an expressive act. Everything in this book exists to help you and your friends express yourselves by creating collaborative social fiction about a party of daring adventurers. You have interesting things to say, and it’s my job to inspire you and maybe also point out a few interesting things I’ve come up with, too. But it's not my job to tell you exactly what to say about everything.
