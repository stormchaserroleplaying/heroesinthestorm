# Loadout
You have access to all of the items on your character sheet. For each quest, decide what your character's load will be. During the operation, you may say that your character has an item on hand by checking the box for the item you want to use, up to a number of items equal to your chosen load. Your load also determines your movement speed and conspicuousness:
* **1-3 load: Light.** You're faster and less conspicuous; you blend in with regular folk.
* **4-6 load: Normal.** You look like a soldier or a bandit, ready for trouble.
* **6-9 load: Heavy.** You're slower. You look like you're on a mission.
* **10+ load: Encumbered.** You're overburdened and can’t do anything except move very slowly.

Some special abilities (like the Warrior's **Mule** ability or a Demon’s incredible strength) increase the load limits.

Some items count as two items for load (they have two connected boxes). Items in italics don’t count toward your load. You don't need to select specific items now. Review your personal items and the standard item descriptions.
