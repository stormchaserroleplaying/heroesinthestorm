# Warrior
You are a dangerous and intimidating fighter. You specialise in physical combat and defend yourself and others with unmatched ferocity.

## Special Abilities

### Bodyguard
When you **protect** a teammate and resist the consequences, you suffer 1 less stress. When you gather information to anticipate possible threats in the current situation, you benefit from increased effect.

### Ghost Fighter
You may imbue your hands, melee weapons, or tools with magic. You gain **potency** in combat vs. the supernatural. You may grapple with spirits to restrain and capture them.

> When you imbue yourself with spirit energy, how do you do it? What does it look like when the energy manifests? When you’re imbued, you can strongly interact with ghosts and spirits, rather than weakly interact.

### Mule 
Your load limits are higher. Light: 5. Normal: 7. Heavy: 8.

### Predator
You gain **potency** whenever you gather information on a weakness or vulnerability of your enemy during combat.

Additionally, you may tick your **ability clock** to gain **potency** vs. weakened or vulnerable targets.

### Rage
You may expend your **special armour** to reduce harm from an attack in combat or to **push yourself** during a fight.

> When you use this ability, tick the special armor box on your playbook sheet. If you “reduce harm” that means that the level of harm you’re facing right now is reduced by one. If you use this ability to push yourself, you get one of the benefits (+1d, +1 effect, act despite severe harm), but you don’t take 2 stress. Your special armor is restored at the beginning of downtime.

### Savagery
When you unleash physical violence, it’s especially frightening. You benefit from **potency** when you **command** a frightened target.

> You instill fear in those around you when you get violent. How they react depends on the person. Some people will flee from you, some will be impressed, some will get violent in return. The GM judges the response of a given NPC.

### Unstoppable
You can **push yourself** to do one of the following: *perform a feat of physical force that verges on the superhuman — engage a small gang on equal footing in close combat*.

> When you push yourself to activate this ability, you still get one of the normal benefits of pushing yourself (+1d, +1 effect, ect.) in addition to the special ability.
> 
> If you perform a feat that verges on the superhuman, you might break a metal weapon with your bare hands, tackle a galloping horse, lift a huge weight, etc.
> 
> If you engage a small gang on equal footing, you don’t suffer reduced effect due to scale against a small gang (up to six people).
