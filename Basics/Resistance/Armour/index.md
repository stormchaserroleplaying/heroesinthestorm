# Armour
If you have a type of armor that applies to the situation, you can mark an armor
box to reduce or avoid a consequence, instead of rolling to resist.

> Alaris is taking level 2 harm, "Cut to the Ribs", and the fight isn't even over yet, so Nick decides to use Alaris's armour to reduce the harm. He marks the armour box and the harm becomes level 1, "Bruised". If Alaris was wearing heavy armour, he could mark a second armor box and reduce the harm again, to zero.

When an armor box is marked, it can’t be used again until it’s restored. All of your armor is restored when you choose your **load** for the next score. See **Loadout**.
