# 3. The GM Sets The Position
Once the player chooses their action, the GM sets the **position** for the roll. The position represents how dangerous or troublesome the action might be. There are three positions: **controlled**, **risky**, and **desperate**. To choose a position, the GM looks at the profiles for the positions below and picks one that most closely matches the situation at hand.

| Position | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| Controlled | You have a golden opportunity. You're exploiting a dominant advantage. You're set up for success. |
| Risky | You go head to head. You're acting under duress. You're taking a chance. |
| Desperate | You're in serious trouble. You're overreaching your capabilities. You're attempting a dangerous maneuver. |

**By default, an action roll is risky.** You wouldn't be rolling if there was no risk involved. If the situation seems more dangerous, make it desperate. If it seems less dangerous, make it controlled.

Choosing the position is an important judgment call and stylistic choice for your game. More controlled action rolls mean generally safer and more dominant adventurers. More desperate action rolls give the game a gritty, underdog kind of feel. There’s no ironclad rule about how to choose positions. It’s meant to be an expressive element of the game. Make the choice that feels right to you and the rest of the group. If you're ever unsure about which position to pick, ask the other players.

As a player, if you're angling for a particular position, ask the GM what you might do to get it, or ask them to clarify the situation to explain their choice.

> *"It’s risky? I was thinking that it'd be controlled. I know that this barkeep is supposed to be a tough old buzzard, but he’s not a real threat to me, is he?"*
> <br><br>
> *“No, I think that the danger is in the situation instead. You're out in the common room in front of everyone, ordering the barkeep to hand over the reward money that he’s supposed to pay the Trio Infernale. Who knows if someone in the room might decide to step up and play hero, or to get on the Trio's good side? It's an uncertain environment. Maybe if you confront the guy alone, that’s more of a controlled position for you. Or maybe if you bring the party with you and make a show of force in front of everyone."*

As GM, you have final say over the position for the roll, but explain and clarify things as needed, especially when you’re starting out. By discussing the position (and how it might be better or worse) you’ll help everyone build a better view of the fictional situation in their minds’ eye and get on the same page about the tone of the game.

You'll also set precedents that the players can build on to make better decisions in the future.

> *"Ah, so we got a controlled **Consort** roll when we wined and dined them and showed them how friendly we are. Noted."*
