# Changing Playbooks or Party Type
A player might want to change their character to a different playbook (a Warrior becomes a Rogue), or the group may decide to shift their crew to a new type (Slayers become a Cult). There are two ways to do this.

* The change represents a "rebuild" of the character or party. For instance, if the PC was created as a Rogue, but after a couple sessions, the player realises that the Ranger playbook is a better fit for what they want to play. In this case, re-create the character or crew anew using the new sheet, keeping the same number of advances already earned.
* The change represents growth into something new, leaving the old life behind. In this case, transfer the action ratings of a PC or the upgrades of a crew to the new sheet (keeping the same total number of action dots or upgrades; you don’t get the “free” elements of the new playbook as extra advancement). You may keep some of the special abilities already earned as Veteran advances.
