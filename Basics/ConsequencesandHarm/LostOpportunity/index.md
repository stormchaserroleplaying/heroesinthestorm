# Lost Opportunity
This consequence represents shifting circumstance. You had an opportunity to achieve your goal with this action, but it slips away. To try again, you need a new approach, usually a new form of action or a change in circumstances. Maybe you tried to **Skirmish** with the noble to trap her on the balcony, but she evades your maneuver and leaps out of reach. If you want to trap her now youâ€™ll have to try another way. Maybe by **Swaying** her with your roguish charm.
