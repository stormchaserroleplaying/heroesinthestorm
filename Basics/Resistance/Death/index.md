# Death
There are a couple of ways for a PC to die:
* If they suffer level 4 fatal harm and they don’t resist it, they die. *Sometimes this is a choice a player wants to make, because they feel like it wouldn’t make sense for the character to survive or it seems right for their character to die here.
* If they need to record harm at level 3 and it’s already filled, they suffer a catastrophic consequence, which might mean sudden death (depending on the circumstances).

When your character dies, you can create a new adventuer to play. Maybe you "promote" one of the party's NPC allies to a PC, or create a brand-new character who joins the party.
