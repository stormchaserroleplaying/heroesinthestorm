# 2. The Player Chooses The Action Rating
The player chooses which **action rating** to roll, following from what their character is doing on-screen. If you want to roll your **Skirmish** action, then get in a fight. If you want to roll your **Command** action, then order someone around. You can’t roll a given action rating unless your character is presently performing that action in the fiction.

There’s definitely some gray area here, where actions overlap and goals can be attempted with a variety of approaches. This is by design. If your goal is to hurt someone with violence, you might **Skirmish** or **Hunt** or **Skulk** or **Wreck**, depending on the situation at hand. If your goal is to dismay and frighten an enemy, you might **Command** or **Sway** or **Wreck**. It’s the player’s choice.
