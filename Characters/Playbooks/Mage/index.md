# Mage
Mages include wizards, sorcerers, warlocks and all manner of arcane spellcasters.

## Special Abilities

### Arcane Barrage
You can add **1 Tick** to your **Ability Clock** in order to **push** yourself to channel powerful offensive magic. This ability can manifest either as a focused attack, such as a beam or ray, or as a widespread attack like a blast of fire.
The first use of this ability allows you to take *both* benefits of pushing yourself: **+1d** and **+1 effect** as you concentrate your magic on one target
The second use of this ability allows you to **push** yourself as normal, but the **scale** of your spell is increased, allowing you to effect a small area or multiple enemies with one attack (up to 6 people)

### Witch Sense
You can always see and feel the currents of magic around you. Take *+1d* whenever you gather information about the arcane by any means.

### Spellbound Strikes
You inscribe your melee weapons with arcane glyphs, imbuing them with sorcerous power. Your weapons are considered magical, and you gain **potency** when using them to attack mundane enemies.
*The arcane power that suffuses a magical blade punches through armor that would turn away the mundane steel edge. Armor with protective enchantments and creatures with supernatural resistance to mundane weapons would cancel out this potency as your arcane assault meets their arcane defense*

### Spellbook
You know the arcane methods to perform ritual sorcery. You can **study** an occult ritual (or create a new one) to summon a supernatural effect or being. You begin with one ritual already learned.

### Defensive Wards
You may expend your **special armor** to resist a magical consequence or to push yourself when you contend with or employ arcane forces.

### Familiar
You seal an extraplanar spirit inside the form of a **pet** that you own. Your pet is now considered magical. You can channel arcane effects through it as if you were standing in its place, and you can see and hear through its eyes and ears *(you are blinded and deafened while you do this)*

### Eldritch Pact
There are many nefarious entities which make their powers available to those willing to serve them. One such entity has gifted you with a small bit of its eldritch power - for a price.
By taking this special ability you gain an additional way to use a **Devil’s Bargain** in any situation and for any end. You do this by calling on your patron (an entity or power defined between the DM and yourself when you take this ability) to imbue you with their power. The consequences of these special **Devil’s Bargain’s** are always aligned with the desires and values of the entity you formed the pact with, as determined by the DM.

### Disjunction
When you encounter an ongoing magical effect or find yourself in the presence of a spell being cast, you may spend **stress** in order to dispel the effect or counter the spell.
The stress that you spend is equal to 2 + the difference between your party’s tier and the quality of the magic you are trying to end.
