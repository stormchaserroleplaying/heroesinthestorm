# Development
To move up the ladder and develop your party, you need **reputation**. **Reputation** is a measure of clout and renown. When you accrue enough rep, the other factions take you more seriously and you attract the support needed to develop and grow.

When you complete a quest, your party earns 2 **reputation**. If the target of the quest is higher Tier than your party, you get **+1 reputation per Tier higher**. If the target of the score is lower Tier, you get **-1 reputation per Tier lower** (minimum zero).

**Reputation** is a kind of abstract currency. Losing reputation can be a consequence paid for actions that negatively affect the credibility of your party, or to limit the reputational harm that might occur due to events in the fiction.

Additionally, reputation is used to increase your Tier. You need **24 reputation** to fill the reputation tracker on your party sheet. When you fill the tracker, you can pay to increase your party Tier by one. This costs coin equal to your **new Tier Ã— 8**. Once you pay the cost to increase your Tier, **subtract 24 from your reputation**.
