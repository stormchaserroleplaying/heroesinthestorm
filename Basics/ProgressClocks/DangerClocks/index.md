# Danger Clocks
The GM can use a clock to represent a progressive danger, like suspicion growing during a seduction, the proximity of pursuers in a chase, or the alert level of guards on patrol. In this case, when a complication occurs, the GM ticks one, two, or three segments on the clock, depending on the consequence level. When the clock is full, the danger comes to fruition. The guards hunt down the intruders, activate an alarm, release the hounds, etc. (See **Consequences**.)
