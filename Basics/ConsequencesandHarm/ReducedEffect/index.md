# Reduced Effect
This consequence represents impaired performance. The PC's action isn't as effective as they'd anticipated. You hit him, but it’s only a flesh wound. She accepts the forged invitation, but she'll keep her eye on you throughout the night. You're able to scale the
wall, but it’s slow going and you're only halfway up. This consequence essentially reduces the effect level of the PC’s action by one after all other factors are accounted for.
