# Character Creation

## Adventurers
Every player character in *Heroes in the Storm* is a daring adventurer, seeking their destiny in the world of Arden. All of them are familiar with the feats represented by the actions of the game. They're all able to **Skirmish** in melee, **Skulk** in the shadows, **Channel** strange energy, **Consort** with contacts for information, and so on.

Because of the way the dice system works, every adventurer can roll at least 2d for any action in the game (+1d from pushing or a Devil’s Bargain, and a +1d assist from a teammate). A roll of 2d is pretty good, statistically. A 75% chance of success. This means that all of the "zero rating" actions on your character sheet don't actually represent deficiencies or gaps of skill; they indicate the actions for which your character is likely to burn stress and rely on teamwork. When your party has your back and you set your mind to it, you can attempt almost anything.

Of course, you'll also have particular talents. You may want to be able to bend magic to your will and observe things far beyond your
senses, or perhaps you want to be the most skilled swordsman in the country. In this chapter, you'll learn how to create your own unique character and choose the abilities that suit the style of play you prefer.

## Choose a Playbook
A playbook is what we call the sheet with all the specific rules to play a certain character type in *Heroes in the Storm*. Rather than a general "adventurer" sheet, the game has several customised playbooks. By choosing a playbook, you're choosing which type of adventurer your character is.

When you choose a playbook, you're choosing a set of **special abilities** (which give your character ways to break the rules in various ways) and a set of **xp triggers** (which determine how you earn experience for character advancement), but every playbook represents an adventurer at heart. The Warrior has special abilities related to combat, but that doesn't mean they're "the fighter" of the game. Any character type can fight well. Think of your playbook as an area of focus and preference, but not a unique skill set.

This is why we call them "playbooks" rather than "character classes" or "archetypes". You're selecting the set of initial action ratings and special abilities that your character has access to, but you're not defining their immutable essence or true nature. Your character will grow and change over time; who they become is part of the fun of playing the game.

> The playbooks are:
> * **Artificer.** Artificers are good at using alchemy and wrecking stuff with sabotage. Play an artificer if you want to be creative with esoteric tools.
> * **Bard.** Bards are good at social situations and subterfuge. Play a Bard if you want to manipulate and deceive people.
> * **Disciple.** Disciples are priestly champions who wield divine magic in service of a higher power.
> * **Mage.** Mages are good at magical stuff and dealing with ghosts. Play a Mage if you want to meddle with arcane powers.
> * **Ranger.** Rangers are good at tracking things down and ranged combat. Play a Ranger if you want to choose your battles.
> * **Rogue** Rogues are good at sneaking around and breaking into places. Play a Rogue if you want to slink in the shadows.
> * **Shaman.** Shamans wield the powers of nature and adopt animal forms.
> * **Warrior.** Warriors are good at winning fights, with violence and with intimidation. Play a Warrior if you want to get your way.

Your playbook choice also represents how the other adventurers of the world see you. The names of the playbooks are colloquial in Arden. If someone solves their problems with by turning to the arcane, people say that they're a "Mage". If they're a smooth talker and shrewd manipulator, people might call them a "Bard". Part of your character’s reputation is reflected by their playbook choice.

Each playbook is detailed in this section. Once you've chosen your playbook, follow the steps below to complete your character.

## Choose A Species
Every character in *Heroes in the Storm* belongs to one of the many intelligent **Species** of Arden. **Humans** are the most widely spread people on the continent of Adrianus, but they live and work alongside **Dwarves**, **Elves** and **Halflings**, which are the most common other species. Some of these species also exhibit distinct **Races**, such as **Wood Elves** and **High Elves** within the Elven species. Countless more unusual species, such as the **Dragonborn**, also populate the world.

The aforementioned species are described in brief below. For an expanded list and more information on the various species, such as the mighty **Goliath** or fiend-blooded **Tieflings**, see [Chapter 10: The World of Arden](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MjDdwBpUGq4HPytadHz).

* **Dragonborn** are draconic humanoids, with elemental affinities resembling those of true dragons.

* **Dwarves** are short and stocky with wide, compact bodies that account for their burly appearance.

* **Elves** are a tall, androgynous people of otherworldly grace, with an affinity for the fey and the natural world.

* **Halflings** have the appearance of small humans with broad hairy feet and a reputation for uncanny luck.

* **Humans** are the most adaptable and driven of Arden's peoples, with great capacity to endure and expand.

## Choose A Homeland
Your character’s **Homeland** describes where their family line is from. When you choose a homeland, note it in your playbook and write a detail about your family life on the line above. For example, you might choose **Breannian** homeland and then write *farmers from Quenlan, now refugees after Norscans burned their village*. Or you might choose **Eldrani** homeland and write *exiled nobility*.

A short selection of possible homelands in eastern Adrianus is described in brief below. For an expanded list and more information on the various regions of the world, such as the diverse provinces of the decadent **Sarameian Empire**, see [Chapter 10: The World of Arden](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MjDdwBpUGq4HPytadHz).

* **Breanne** is a predominantly human and strongly religious kingdom. **Touchstone:** Western Europe.

* The forest of **Eldren** is home to the treetop kingdom of the Eldrani elves, famed for their craft and artistry.

* **Khazak Ankor** is a partially subterranean mountain nation of technologically advanced dwarves.

* **Littlewood** is a republic of halflings and gnomes founded as a safe haven for Arden's little folk.

* **Norsca** is a frozen archipelago inhabited by eleven clans of seafaring raiders. **Touchstone:** Scandinavia.

## Choose A Background
Your character's **background** describes what they did before they joined the crew. Choose one of the general background options from the list on your playbook, then write a detail about it that’s specific to your character. For example, you could choose **Labour**, and then write *sailor on a mutiny ship with few survivors*. Or you might choose Law and write Former Bluecoat. See more examples below.

* **Academic:** A scholar, clerk, teacher, astrologer, engineer, artist, tutor, alchemist, mage, etc.

* **Labour:** A servant, blacksmith, mason, carpenter, butcher, fisher, teamster, nanny, wainwright, cook, sailor, etc.

* **Merchant:** A shopkeeper, merchant, crafter, trader, tinker, etc.

* **Military:** A knight, soldier, mercenary, guard member, spy, war leader, fight instructor, etc.

* **Peasant:** Farmer, herder, beekeeper, orchardist, etc.

* **Noble:** A member of a high, noble, or fallen house; an heir, scion, courtier, illegitimate child, etc.

* **Religion:** A priest, priestess, acolyte, temple guard, temple servant, or cult member.

* **Underworld:** A street urchin, gang member, robber, beggar, prostitute, thug, thief, cutpurse, brigand, smuggler, or other outcast.

## Assign Four Action Dots
Your playbook begins with three action dots already placed. You get to add four more dots (so you'll have seven total). At the start of the game, no action rating may have more than two dots (unless a special ability tells you otherwise). Brief descriptions of all the actions follow. Assign your four dots like this:

* Put one dot in any action that you feel reflects your character's **homeland**.
* Put one dot in any action that you feel reflects your character’s **background**.
* Assign two more dots anywhere you please (max rating is 2, remember).

## Choose A Special Ability
Take a look at the special abilities for your playbook and choose one. If you can’t decide which one to pick, go with the first one on the list. It’s placed there as a good default choice.

### Special Defence
Some special abilities refer to your special defence. Each character sheet has a box to track usage of special defence. If you have any abilities that use your special defence, tick its box when you activate one of them. If you don't have any special abilities that use special defence, then you can't use that box at all.

## Choose One Close Friend & One Rival
Each playbook has a list of NPCs that your character knows. Choose one from the list who is a close relationship (a good friend, a lover, a family relation, etc.). Mark the upward-pointing triangle next to their name. Then choose another NPC on the list who’s your rival or enemy. Mark the downward-pointing triangle next to their name.

## Choose Your Respite
Every adventurer needs some respite or another, to which they turn to deal with stress. Choose a respite from the list, and describe it on the line above with the specific details and the name and location of those with whom you recover from stress. For example, you might choose **Stupor** and write *alcohol*. Ask your table if you get stuck on what kinds of respite might be fitting with the story and your character.

* **Faith:** You're dedicated to an unseen power, god, ancestor, etc.

* **Gambling:** You crave games of chance, betting on sporting events, etc.

* **Luxury:** Expensive or ostentatious displays of opulence.

* **Obligation:** You’re devoted to a family, a cause, an organization, a charity, etc.

* **Pleasure:** Gratification from lovers, food, drink, drugs, art, theater, etc.

* **Stupor:** You seek oblivion in the abuse of drugs, drinking to excess, getting beaten to a pulp in the fighting pits, etc.

* **Weird:** You experiment with strange essences, consort with rogue spirits, observe bizarre rituals or taboos, etc.

## Record Your Name, Alias, & Look
Choose a name for your character. If your character uses an alias or nickname, make a note of it. Record a few evocative words that describe your character’s look.

## Review Your Details
Take a look at the details on your character sheet, especially the **experience triggers** for your playbook (for example "earn xp when you address a challenge with knowledge or arcane power") and the **special items** available to a character of your type (for example, *************). You begin with access to all of the items on your sheet, so don't worry about picking specific things. You'll decide what your character is carrying later on, when you're on the quest (see **Loadout**).

That’s it! Your character is ready for play. When you start the first session, the GM will ask you some questions about who you are, your outlook, or some past events. If you don’t know the answers, make some up. Or ask the other players for ideas.

## Character Creation Summary

2. **Choose a species.** Your species grants you its own unique abilities.

3. **Choose a homeland.** Detail your choice with a note about your family life. For example, *Breanne: farmers, now war refugees in Quenlan*.
 
4. **Choose a background.** Detail your choice with your specific history. For example, *Labour: sailor, mutineer*.

5. **Assign four action dots.** No action may begin with a rating higher than 2 during character creation. (After creation, action ratings may advance up to 4.)

6. **Choose a special ability.** They're in the gray column in the middle of the character sheet. If you can’t decide, choose the first ability on the list. It’s placed there as a good first option.
 
7. **Choose a close friend and a rival.** Mark the one who is a close friend, long-time ally, family relation, or lover (the upward-pointingtriangle). Mark one who is a rival, enemy, scorned lover, betrayed partner, etc. (the downward-pointing triangle).

9. **Record your name, alias, and look.** Choose a name, an alias (if you use one), and jot down a few words to describe your look.

## Loadout
You have access to all of the items on your character sheet. For each quest, decide what your character's load will be. During the operation, you may say that your character has an item on hand by checking the box for the item you want to use, up to a number of items equal to your chosen load. Your load also determines your movement speed and conspicuousness:

* **1-3 load: Light.** You're faster and less conspicuous; you blend in with regular folk.
* **4-6 load: Normal.** You look like a soldier or a bandit, ready for trouble.
* **6-9 load: Heavy.** You're slower. You look like you're on a mission.
* **10+ load: Encumbered.** You're overburdened and can’t do anything except move very slowly.

Some special abilities (like the Warrior's **Mule** ability or a Demon’s incredible strength) increase the load limits.

Some items count as two items for load (they have two connected boxes). Items in italics don’t count toward your load. You don't need to select specific items now. Review your personal items and the standard item descriptions.

## Actions
When you **Channel**, you open your mind to arcane or divine power.

*You might cast a spell or understand aspects of arcana. You could try to perceive beyond sight in order to better understand your situation (but Surveying might be better).*

When you **Command**, you compel swift obedience.

You might make new friends or connect with your heritage or background. You could try to manipulate your friends with social pressure (but Sway might be better).*

When you **Hunt**, you carefully track a target.

*You might follow a target or discover their location. You might arrange an ambush. You might attack with precision shooting from a distance. You could try to bring your guns to bear in a melee (but Skirmishing might be better).*

When you **Skirmish**, you entangle a target in close combat so they can’t easily escape.

*You might brawl or wrestle with them. You might hack and slash. You might seize or hold a position in battle. You could try to fight in a formal duel (but Finessing might be better).*

When you **Skulk**, you move stealthily or without being noticed. You dextrously manipulate or subtly misdirect.

*You might sneak past a guard or hide in the shadows. You might pick someone’s pocket. You might attack someone from hiding with a backstab or blackjack. You could try to waylay a victim in the midst of battle (but Skirmishing might be better).*

When you **Study**, you scrutinize details and interpret evidence.

*You might gather information from documents, newspapers, and books. You might do research on an esoteric topic. You might closely analyse a person to detect lies or true feelings. You could try to examine events to understand a pressing situation (but Surveying might be better).*

When you **Survey**, you observe the situation and anticipate outcomes.

*You might spot telltale signs of trouble before it happens. You might uncover opportunities or weaknesses. You might detect a person’s motivations or intentions. You could try to spot a good ambush point (but Hunting might be better).*

When you **Sway**, you influence with guile, charm, or argument.

*You might lie convincingly. You might persuade someone to do what you want. You might argue a compelling case that leaves no clear rebuttal. You could try to trick people into affection or obedience (but Consorting or Commanding might be better).*

When you **Tinker**, you fiddle with devices and mechanisms.

*You might create a new gadget or alter an existing item. You might pick a lock or crack a safe. You might disable an alarm or trap. You might turn the clockwork devices to your advantage. You could try to use your technical expertise to control a vehicle (but Traversing might be better).*

When you **Traverse**, you lift, climb, jump, run, or swim, usually either away from or into danger.

*You might run and leap across the rooftops. You might climb up the side of a cliff to approach a fortress. You might handle the controls of a vehicle or direct a mount. You might dodge arrows as you run for your horse. You might chase after a mark you're following (though skulk might be better).*

When you **Wreck**, you unleash savage force.

*You might smash down a door or wall with a sledgehammer, or use an explosive to do the same. You might employ chaos or sabotage to create a distraction or overcome an obstacle. You could try to overwhelm an enemy with sheer force in battle (but Skirmishing might be better).*

As you can see, many actions overlap with others. This is by design. As a player, you get to choose which action you roll, by saying what your character does. Can you try to **Wreck** someone during a fight? Sure! The GM tells you the position and effect level of your action in this circumstance. As it says, Skirmish might be better (less risky or more effective), depending on the situation at hand (sometimes it won’t be better).

For a complete description of each action, with examples, see Chapter 6.
