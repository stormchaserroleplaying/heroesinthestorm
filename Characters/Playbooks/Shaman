# Shaman
Shamans commune with the spirits of nature and draw power from this relationship. They are typically fierce protectors of the natural world, and can also use their mystic abilities to heal others.

## Special Abilities

### Bestial Form
You can add **1 Tick** to your **Ability Clock** take on the physical form of an animal of your choice that you are familiar with in order to gain **potency** with one action for the duration of your transformation
Only certain actions are viable choices for this ability based on the animal that you choose. You could shift into a **hound** to gain potency in survey, a charging bull to gain potency in **wreck**, a slinky housecat to **skulk** more effectively, or maybe a nimble monkey in order to gain potency in **traverse**
The transformation lasts until the end of the encounter unless you choose to end it sooner or you tick your ability clock again to choose a different form
The animal you choose can not be of a **Scale** higher than your **Tier**

### Voice of the Wild
Beasts, plants, and spirits of nature understand your speech and you can understand theirs. You gain **potency** when communicating with them

### Protective Spirits
The spirits from which you draw power defend you and your allies from harm. They might whirl around you as a protective shroud or imbue an ally with the defensive qualities of bark or stone. You may add **1 Tick** to your **Ability Clock** in order to give **armor** to yourself or an ally for the duration of an encounter. If you or the ally already have armor, this ability instead gives you **heavy armor**

### Herbalist
When you gather herbs or craft a recipe with herbal reagents you gain **+1 result level** to your roll. You begin with one such special recipe already known

### Rapid Regeneration
You can make a **channel fortune roll** to cause the life-giving magic of nature to accelerate the natural healing capabilities of you and your allies’ bodies. Depending on your success, one or more members of the party gain +1 result level to their healing treatment rolls.
*Rolling a 1 means that one person can benefit from this ability, rolling a 2 means that two can benefit, and so on*

### Frondescence
You are adept at magically controlling plant life: leaves unfurl at your touch, flowers bloom as you walk by, and roots snake across the ground to clear your path. You may add **1 Tick** to your **Ability Clock** to empower your control over plant life in one of the following ways:
**Ensnaring Roots** - The ground becomes overgrown with tangled roots making it difficult for anyone to move in the area and possibly restraining your foes
**Lashing Vines** - Thick ropes of thorn covered vines erupt from a location you can see or grow from your arms like whips. These vines can be used as weapons to attack or like grappling hooks to help you maneuver 
**Abundant Growth** - You invest your magic into the ground or water at your feet, revitalizing it. You could restore a burnt field of crops, rid a large tree of disease, or cleanse a poisoned well. You may also **push** yourself to increase the scale of this ability, allowing you to restore all the land surrounding a small village.

### Spore Cloud
You’ve been inoculated by a community of magical fungi which sometimes sprout from your clothes and hair, and a cloud of their spores surrounds you at all times. These spores fortify your lungs, allowing you to take **1 less stress** when you **resist** harm from airborne sources. In addition, when you successfully damage a foe you may add **1 Tick** to your **Ability Clock** to cause these spores to swirl out and leave your foe poisoned or dazed. This ability only works against creatures which need to breathe

### Dreamwalker
You know the mystic rituals required to enter the world of dreams while asleep or in trance. These rituals require at least an hour of preparation, and may also require specific herbs and regents as determined by the dm
When you enter your own dreams, you may encounter spirits, ancestors, or even the avatars of deities. You may attempt to **consort** with them to gain information or **sway** them to assist you in some way
When you enter another’s dreams, you must **channel** in order to project your own spirit into their mind. Entering another’s dreams is easier if you are a trusted friend of the person or if they are in close proximity to you while they sleep. While in another’s dreams, you gain **+1 effect level** when you attempt to sway them, when you attempt to **study** their mind to gain insight on their fears or desires, or if you attempt to **channel** to soothe them and relieve their stress. Dangers of dreamwalking typically include encountering a person’s nightmares, which can not kill you but can deal harm to your psyche
You can **tick** your **Ability Clock** in order to bring along other people into the dream world, spending 1 tick for each person beyond yourself.
