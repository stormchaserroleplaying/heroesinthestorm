# Stash & Retirement
When you mark your character’s final **trauma** and they retire, the amount of **coin** they've managed to stash away determines their fate. Your **stash** tracker is on your character sheet.

* **Stash 0-10: Poor soul.** You end up in the gutter, awash in vice and misery.
* **Stash 11-20: Meager.** A tiny hovel that you can call your own.
* **Stash 21-39: Modest.** A simple home or apartment, with some small comforts. You might operate a tavern or small business.
* **Stash 40: Fine.** A well-appointed home or apartment, claiming a few luxuries. You might operate a medium business.

In addition, each full row of stash (10 **coin**) indicates the **quality level of the adventurer’s lifestyle**, from zero (street life) to four (luxury).

> *Petros Pantelis is a rogue who cares a great deal about his sartorial swagger, and Rick, his player, often describes Petros as modeling the most stylish and outrageous fashion to impress his peers. But he’s just some street rat, right? How impressively is he really dressed? The GM can call for a **fortune roll** using Petros’s lifestyle level as the dice pool to find out how much impact the attire has.*

> *Shiva wants some alone-time with a prospective new friend, but she can’t take them back to where she's hiding out, so what to do? Kai, Shiva’s player, says she wants to rent a nice room for the evening, so the GM asks for a fortune roll using Shiva’s lifestyle rating to see what quality of room Shiva can manage.*

## Removing Coin From Your Stash
If you want to pull coin out of your stash, you may do so, at a cost. Your character sells off some of their assets and investments in order to get some quick cash. **For every 2 stash removed, you get 1 coin in cash.**
