# Choose Details

## Choose One Close Friend & One Rival
Each playbook has a list of NPCs that your character knows. Choose one from the list who is a close relationship (a good friend, a lover, a family relation, etc.). Mark the upward-pointing triangle next to their name. Then choose another NPC on the list who’s your rival or enemy. Mark the downward-pointing triangle next to their name.

## Choose Your Respite
Every adventurer needs some respite or another, to which they turn to deal with stress. Choose a respite from the list, and describe it on the line above with the specific details and the name and location of those with whom you recover from stress. For example, you might choose **Stupor** and write *alcohol*. Ask your table if you get stuck on what kinds of respite might be fitting with the story and your character.

* **Faith:** You're dedicated to an unseen power, god, ancestor, etc.

* **Gambling:** You crave games of chance, betting on sporting events, etc.

* **Luxury:** Expensive or ostentatious displays of opulence.

* **Obligation:** You’re devoted to a family, a cause, an organization, a charity, etc.

* **Pleasure:** Gratification from lovers, food, drink, drugs, art, theater, etc.

* **Stupor:** You seek oblivion in the abuse of drugs, drinking to excess, getting beaten to a pulp in the fighting pits, etc.

* **Weird:** You experiment with strange essences, consort with rogue spirits, observe bizarre rituals or taboos, etc.

## Record Your Name, Alias, & Look
Choose a name for your character. If your character uses an alias or nickname, make a note of it. Record a few evocative words that describe your character’s look.

## Review Your Details
Take a look at the details on your character sheet, especially the **experience triggers** for your playbook (for example "earn xp when you address a challenge with knowledge or arcane power") and the **special items** available to a character of your type (for example, *************). You begin with access to all of the items on your sheet, so don't worry about picking specific things. You'll decide what your character is carrying later on, when you're on the quest (see **Loadout**).

That’s it! Your character is ready for play. When you start the first session, the GM will ask you some questions about who you are, your outlook, or some past events. If you don’t know the answers, make some up. Or ask the other players for ideas.
