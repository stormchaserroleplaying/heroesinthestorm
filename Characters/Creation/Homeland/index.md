# Choose A Homeland
Your characterâ€™s **Homeland** describes where their family line is from. When you choose a homeland, note it in your playbook and write a detail about your family life on the line above. For example, you might choose **Breannian** homeland and then write *farmers from Quenlan, now refugees after Norscans burned their village*. Or you might choose **Eldrani** homeland and write *exiled nobility*.

A short selection of possible homelands in eastern Adrianus is described in brief below. For an expanded list and more information on the various regions of the world, such as the diverse provinces of the decadent **Sarameian Empire**, see [here](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/Arden/Regions/).

* **Breanne** is a predominantly human and strongly religious kingdom. **Touchstone:** Western Europe.

* The forest of **Eldren** is home to the treetop kingdom of the Eldrani elves, famed for their craft and artistry.

* **Khazak Ankor** is a partially subterranean mountain nation of technologically advanced dwarves.

* **Littlewood** is a republic of halflings and gnomes founded as a safe haven for Arden's little folk.

* **Norsca** is a frozen archipelago inhabited by eleven clans of seafaring raiders. **Touchstone:** Scandinavia.
