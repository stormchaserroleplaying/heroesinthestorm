# Gathering Information

The flow of information from the GM to the players about the fictional world is very important in a roleplaying game. By default, the GM tells the players what their characters perceive, suspect, and intuit. However, there’s just too much going on to say everything. It would take forever and be boring, too. The players have a tool at their disposal to more fully investigate the fictional world.

When you want to know something specific about the fictional world, your character can **gather information**. The GM will ask you how your character gathers the info (or how they learned it in the past).

If it’s common knowledge, the GM will simply answer your questions. If there’s an obstacle to the discovery of the answer, an action roll is called for. If it’s not common knowledge but there’s no obstacle, a simple fortune roll determines the quality of the information you gather.

> *For instance, if you decide to grab Avrick the powder dealer and **Command** him to talk, you could ask, “Where does he get his supply?” Avrick isn't tough enough to stand up to you, so it’s a simple fortune roll to see how much he talks. On a **1-3**, he admits that he gets his supply from the Francesc the Bull. On a **4/5**, he also tells you that he works for Francesc because he forced him to. On a **6**, he also reveals the time and place that he picks up the stash each week. On a **critical**, he’ll even tell you a secret that he discovered: Francesc gets the drugs from diplomatic couriers from Sarameia.*

Each attempt to gather information takes time. If the situation allows, you can try again if you don't initially get all the info that you want. But often, the opportunity is fleeting, and you'll only get one chance to roll for that particular question.

Some example questions are on the bottom of the character sheet. The GM always answers honestly, but with a level of detail according to the level of effect.

The most common gather information actions are **Surveying** the situation to reveal or anticipate what’s going on and **Studying** a person to understand what they intend to do or what they're really thinking.

Sometimes, you’ll have to maneuver yourself into position before you can gather information. For example, you might have to **Prowl** to a good hiding place first and then **Study** the cultists when they perform their dark ritual.

## Making a Gather Information Roll
*Ask a question and make an action roll or a fortune roll. The GM answers you honestly, with a level of detail depending on the effect level.*

| Effect | Result |
|:-------|:-------|
| Great | You get exceptional details. The information is complete and follow-up questions may expand into related areas or reveal more than you hoped for. |
| Standard | You get good details. Clarifying and follow-up questions are possible. |
| Limited | You get incomplete or partial information. More information gathering will be needed to get all the answers. |
