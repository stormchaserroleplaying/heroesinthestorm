# Elemental Lineage
Whether through the fertile power of a magical storm, a bloodline traced back to spirits of earth, or decades of training and magical precision, the natural world has left an indellible mark on you. 

## Special Abilities

### Dynamo
You don't just command lightning, it flies through your very veins. Lightning-based attacks suffer reduced effect against you, and you may tick your Ability Clock when you are hit with lightning to ignore harm on your next action as the lightning empowers you.

### Be Like Water
You are at one with water and exemplify its properties. You are able to breathe water and move through it unimpeded. Additionally, you may tick your Ability Clock to alter the state of free flowing water near you (i.e. transform it into ice or steam). 

### Stoneborn
You are sturdy, reliable and unmoveable. Non-metal weapons have reduced effect against your impenetrable skin and you may tick your Ability Clock to mold earth around you or pass through it as if it were water. 

### Wind and Sky
You embody a freedom unlike any other, for the wind travels subtly and without constraint. You may tick your ability clock to manifest brief periods of intangibility. While intangible:
* You gain potency against any attempts to restrain you.
* Any harm inflicted by falling is negated.
* The effect of the next attack made against you is reduced.

### Heart Aflame
Your spirit carries the strength, passion and life-giving energy that is fire itself. Fire-based attacks suffer reduced effect against you and may tick your ability clock to wreathe your body in powerful flames that are harmless to you.  

### Storm's Might
The primordial power of great storms dwell within you, waiting to be called upon. You are able to move as thunder does, appearing to teleport to a nearby space. Additionally, you may tick your ability clock after a skirmish, wreck, or channel roll to knock a target back or increase effect against a structure.
