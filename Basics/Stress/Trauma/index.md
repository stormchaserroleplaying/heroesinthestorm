# Trauma
When a PC marks their last stress box, they suffer a level of **trauma**. When you take **trauma**, circle one of your trauma conditions like *Cold*, *Reckless*, *Unstable*, etc.

When you suffer **trauma**, you're taken out of action. You’re “left for dead” or otherwise dropped out of the current conflict, only to come back later, shaken and drained. When you return, **you have zero stress** and your vice has been satisfied for the next downtime (see **Vice**).

**Trauma conditions are permanent.** Your character acquires the new personality quirk indicated by the condition, and can earn xp by using it to cause trouble. **When you mark your fourth trauma condition**, your character cannot continue as a daring adventurer. You must retire them to a different life, see **Stash & Retirement**.

## Trauma Conditions
* **Cold:** You're not moved by emotional appeals or social bonds.
* **Haunted:** You're often lost in reverie, reliving past horrors, seeing things.
* **Obsessed:** You're enthralled by one thing: an activity, a person, an ideology.
* **Paranoid:** You imagine danger everywhere; you can't trust others.
* **Reckless:** You have little regard for your own safety or best interests.
* **Soft:** You lose your edge; you become sentimental, passive, gentle.
* **Unstable:** Your emotional state is volatile. You can instantly rage, or fall into despair, act impulsively, or freeze up.
* **Vicious:** You seek out opportunities to hurt people, even for no good reason.

You can play your trauma conditions as much or as little as you like. They can totally transform your character’s persona or have only a small impact. It’s up to you. If you do play them strongly, though, allowing a trauma condition to complicate your character’s life, you earn **xp** for it, see **Advancement**.
