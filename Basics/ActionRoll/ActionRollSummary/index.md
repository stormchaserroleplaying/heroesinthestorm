# Action Roll Summary

* A player or GM calls for a roll. Make an **action roll** when the character performs a dangerous or troublesome action.
* The player chooses the **action rating** to roll. Choose the action that matches what the character is doing in the fiction.
* The GM establishes the **position** and **effect level** of the action. The choice of position and effect is influenced strongly by the player’s choice of action.
* Add up to two bonus dice. 1) **Assistance** from a teammate. 2) **Push yourself** (take 2 stress) or accept a **Devil’s Bargain**.
* Roll the dice pool and judge the outcome. The players and GM narrate the action together. The GM has final say over what happens and inflicts consequences as called for by the position and the result of the roll.

> * **1d** for each **Action** rating dot.
> * **+1d** if you have **Assistance**.
> * **+1d** if you **Push** yourself -or- you accept a **Devil's Bargain**.
