# The Setting
The game takes place in the distant world of **Arden**. It's **late medieval** in its development. Imagine a world like ours during the 15th century, at the dawn of the Renaissance. There are horse-drawn carriages, sailing ships, primitive gunpowder technology and the printing press has just been invented, but has yet to take the world by storm.

Arden is also a **fantasy** populated by dragons, dwarves, elves, giants, gnomes, goblins, halflings, orcs and many other exotic and magical peoples. The poles of the world are boiling deserts, scorched by a sun from which the only respite is the nightly eclipse of a vast silver moon. A great ring of ice encircles the equator, which knows only two distant stars, one of which always hangs in the sky.

More gold and jewels and magic lost to man have fallen between the cracks in the world than you can imagine. Who better to retrieve it than a band of stalwart heroes? You and your friends *are* those heroes. You go where others can't or won't. There are monstrous things lurking in Arden. Are you ready to face them?
