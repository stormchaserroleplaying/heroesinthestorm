# Shadow Lineage
Whether by birth or by unholy magic, darkness and shadow suffuse your soul. Though warmth and joy may seem distant to you, that is only a small price to pay for the powers that you have been granted.

## Special Abilities

### Eyes of Night
Your eyes pierce through even the darkest shadows, magical or otherwise. Darkness never negatively impacts your **effect** when taking actions that rely on your ability to see.

### Graveborn
Your skin is cold to the touch and your pulse barely there. The life within you is so close to the grave that it would be easy to mistake you for a corpse. You don’t need to eat, drink, or sleep. In addition, unintelligent undead creatures perceive you as being one of them and don’t attack you unless provoked. Magic that can detect the presence of undead creatures may sense your deathly presence as well.

### Infectious Gloom
Your words hang heavy in the minds of those who hear you, sapping the will from their hearts and the strength from their limbs. When you successfully **command** or **sway** someone using negative viewpoints, demoralising words, or predictions of doom, you may tick your **ability clock** to leave them debilitatingly sorrowful, terrified, or anguished.

### Life Siphon
The shadows devour warmth and life... and so do you. When you successfully hit a foe with a spell or magical weapon, you may:
* Tick your **ability clock** to clear **1 stress**.
* Tick your **ability clock** twice to heal **1 level of harm**.

### Necromancy
You have learned the dark rites necessary to raise the dead. You have **potency** when you **channel** to animate corpses and skeletons, or to bind spirits to serve you. The GM determines how difficult this magic is based on the nature of the corpses, or whether or not there are any spirits nearby.

### Obfuscation
The shadows cling to you like a protective cloak. While in areas of dim light or darkness you are harder to see. If you remain still, you become invisible entirely. You can push yourself in order to extend this ability to your party for one encounter, so long as they remain near you.

### Shadowcraft
Your affinity for the shadows allows you to shape immaterial darkness into tangible forms. You may tick to your **ability clock** to shape the shadows into any one of the following forms:
* **Blade** - A weapon of inky darkness, this shadow blade reappears in your hands after it is thrown. It is more effective when you are in an area of dim or dark light.
* **Tendrils** - These black tendrils reach from the shadows to harry and restrain your foes.
* **Beast** - Whether a single large beast, such as a shadow hound, or a swarm of smaller creatures, such as bats, these shadowy creatures follow your commands, attack your foes and defend you from danger.

### Shadow Step
You’ve gained the ability to leap from one pool of shadow to another nearby. When you teleport in this way you may do one of the following:
* Use your **special armour** to reduce incoming **harm** as you become incorporeal and vanish in the nick of time to avoid danger, apparating in the shadows nearby.
* Tick your **ability clock** to gain the effects of pushing when you **hunt**, **skirmish**, **skulk**, or **traverse**, as you teleport to a more advantageous location to surprise your opponents or use the shadows to maneuver around obstacles and prying eyes.
