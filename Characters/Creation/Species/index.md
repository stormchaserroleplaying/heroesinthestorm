# Choose A Species
Every character in *Heroes in the Storm* belongs to one of the many intelligent **Species** of Arden. **Humans** are the most widely spread people on the continent of Adrianus, but they live and work alongside **Dwarves**, **Elves** and **Halflings**, which are the most common other species. Some of these species also exhibit distinct **Races**, such as **Wood Elves** and **High Elves** within the Elven species. Countless more unusual species, such as the **Dragonborn**, also populate the world.

The aforementioned species are described in brief below. For an expanded list and more information on the various species, such as the mighty **Goliath**, or fiend-blooded **Tieflings**, see [here](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/Arden/Species/).

* **Dragonborn** are draconic humanoids, with elemental affinities resembling those of true dragons.

* **Dwarves** are short and stocky with wide, compact bodies that account for their burly appearance.

* **Elves** are a tall, androgynous people of otherworldly grace, with an affinity for the fey and the natural world.

* **Halflings** have the appearance of small humans with broad hairy feet and a reputation for uncanny luck.

* **Humans** are the most adaptable and driven of Arden's peoples, with great capacity to endure and expand.
