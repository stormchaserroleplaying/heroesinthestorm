# Demonic Lineage
The unspeakable power and corruption of the abyss found its way into your bloodline, granting you grotesque and demonic abilities. Demons exist only to corrupt, bespoil and destroy. Their abilities are greatly feared and their only law is strength. Such terrible chaos now calls out to you.

## Special Abilities

### Blood Rush
Your body responds to violence like a stimulant. When you successfully attack a new target for the first time, you may tick your ability clock to clear 1 stress.

### Demonic Arsenal
You can call upon your demon blood to transform into a monstrous demonic form. At will, you may manifest both claws (treated as blades) and scales or chitin (treated as armour). This armour stacks with worn armour to become heavy armour.

### Caustic Blood
Your blood is volatile and burns objects and creatures like acid.

### Horrific Transformation
You allow the latent demonic power inside of you to surface and make its presence known. Tick your ability clock twice and choose two effects from the list below. Your body warps and shifts to produce these changes.
* You grow serrated claws capable of clinging to walls and ceilings.
* Your form grows to twice its normal size.
* Your bones warp into flexible cartilage that allows for inhuman limb movement and passage through incredibly tight spaces.
* Many eyes cover the upper portion of your face, granting you 360-degree vision.

Optionally, you may push yourself or take a Devil’s Bargain to manifest a third change.

### Sanguine Plague
Large serpents or insects spring forth from any surface touched by your blood. These creatures are both poisonous and aggressive. The number of creatures generated is dependent on the level of the harm inflicted. Lesser harm (level 1) produces 1 creature, moderate harm (level 2) produces 2 creatures and severe harm (level 3) produces 3 creatures.

### Spontaneous Mutation
The chaotic nature of your demonic blood warps your flesh, granting you limited shapeshifting abilities. You may make a Channel action roll to shift your form, alter your appearance, or manifest new bodily adaptations. These changes are often aberrant and difficult to control.

### Living Corruption
You tick your ability clock to make yourself a sentient anathema to life, poisoning and altering all that you touch with malignance. While active, water, crops, and other aspects of the natural world are wounded by your touch, doing damage equal to your tier +1. Additionally, those you attack while in this state have a chance to be poisoned, reducing their effect.

### Abyssal Host/Reliquary
You may host the monstrous spirits of the Abyss within your soul, allowing them to strike out with terrible and indiscriminate violence. Rather than resist, you may tick your ability clock in response to receiving harm to have the spirits lash out and inflict equal harm to your aggressor. You incur stress equal to the level of harm endured when you use this ability.
You may tick your ability clock to cast these spirits out without provocation to silently hound your target. After a time period of the GM’s discretion, the spirits cause level 1 harm to the target, and you incur 1 stress upon the moment of attack.
