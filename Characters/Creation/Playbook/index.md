# Choose a Playbook
A playbook is what we call the sheet with all the specific rules to play a certain character type in *Heroes in the Storm*. Rather than a general "adventurer" sheet, the game has several customised playbooks. By choosing a playbook, you're choosing which type of adventurer your character is.

When you choose a playbook, you're choosing a set of **special abilities** (which give your character ways to break the rules in various ways) and a set of **xp triggers** (which determine how you earn experience for character advancement), but every playbook represents an adventurer at heart. The Warrior has special abilities related to combat, but that doesn't mean they're "the fighter" of the game. Any character type can fight well. Think of your playbook as an area of focus and preference, but not a unique skill set.

This is why we call them "playbooks" rather than "character classes" or "archetypes". You're selecting the set of initial action ratings and special abilities that your character has access to, but you're not defining their immutable essence or true nature. Your character will grow and change over time; who they become is part of the fun of playing the game.

The playbooks are:
* **Artificer.** Artificers are good at using alchemy and wrecking stuff with sabotage. Play an artificer if you want to be creative with esoteric tools.
* **Bard.** Bards are good at social situations and subterfuge. Play a Bard if you want to manipulate and deceive people.
* **Disciple.** Disciples are priestly champions who wield divine magic in service of a higher power.
* **Mage.** Mages are good at magical stuff and dealing with ghosts. Play a Mage if you want to meddle with arcane powers.
* **Ranger.** Rangers are good at tracking things down and ranged combat. Play a Ranger if you want to choose your battles.
* **Rogue** Rogues are good at sneaking around and breaking into places. Play a Rogue if you want to slink in the shadows.
* **Shaman.** Shamans wield the powers of nature and adopt animal forms.
* **Warrior.** Warriors are good at winning fights, with violence and with intimidation. Play a Warrior if you want to get your way.

Your playbook choice also represents how the other adventurers of the world see you. The names of the playbooks are colloquial in Arden. If someone solves their problems with by turning to the arcane, people say that they're a "Mage". If they're a smooth talker and shrewd manipulator, people might call them a "Bard". Part of your character’s reputation is reflected by their playbook choice.

Each playbook is detailed in this section. Once you've chosen your playbook, follow the steps below to complete your character.
