# Infernal Lineage
Your lineage can be traced back to a powerful entity of hell, which has imbued you with unique and terrible abilities. An Infernal heritage manifests differently for each, often influenced by the extent to which they revel in the patient and methodical evil that partially defines their origin.

## Special Abilities

### Infernal Authority
Hell is governed by a strict hierarchy in which the weak submit to the strong. You project this same air of superiority when interacting with lesser beings. Creatures of a lower tier than you recognise that you are not to be trifled with and are less inclined to cause trouble for you. When you successfully Command a creature of lesser tier, you may afflict them with Level 1 Harm - Cowed.

### Brand of Damnation
You mark the soul of a target to be cast into the great conflagration upon death. An infernal sigil manifests upon the flesh of a creature in range that saps at their life force; anyone attacked by this creature gains +1d to resist. If the marked creature dies during this encounter, you clear 1 stress.

### Devil's Tongue
People find you disarmingly alluring or amiable and they readily bend to your wishes. You have potency when you Consort or Sway using deceitful or seductive words. Additionally, magic to determine if you are being truthful always indicates that you are telling the truth, and you cannot be magically compelled to tell the truth.

### Hellish Constitution
Each layer of hell exist is more hostile than the last, but your body is adaptated to withstand such conditions. You take +1d when resisting damage from fire, cold, and physical attacks from nonmagical weapons and incur 1 less stress when you do so.

### Blade of Phlegethos
You can tick your Ability Clock to manifest an obsidian blade that glows with an internal heat. This weapon can be summoned and dismissed at will, and you can tick your Ability Clock again to cause the weapon to emit a powerful wave of flame.

### Dark Contract
You have learned to scribe infernal contracts that bind a creature to your service. You begin with one such contract already enacted.

You determine the terms of the contract. Contracts typically involve a service that the entity will perform for you, such as protecting your life or most valuable possessions or devotion to a concept or cause that you define.

To scribe an infernal contract make a Study action roll, the result of which determines the conditions of the contract, depending on skillfully the fine print and loopholes of the contract are written.
* On a 1, you have to uphold your end of the bargain completely and the other party does not entirely fulfill theirs.
* On a 2, the contract is equitable and both parties must uphold their end of the bargain.
* On a 3, the other party must fulfill their obligation, but you must only partially keep your end of the deal.
* On a 4, the other party must fulfill their obligation, but you must not.
