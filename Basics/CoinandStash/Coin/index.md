# Coin
**Coin** is an abstract measure of cash and liquid assets. The major nations of Adrianus mint coins of platinum, gold, silver and copper. One platinum piece is valuable enough to cover a major transaction. "Flashing a coin" is considered an ostentatious display of wealth. Most ordinary folk use small silver pieces for currency.

The few silver pieces the PCs use in their daily lives are not tracked. If an adventurer wants to toss a few silver around to achieve a small goal (bribe a doorman), use the PC's **lifestyle quality** for a fortune roll (see **Stash**).

## Monetary Values
* **1 Coin:** A full purse of silver pieces. A week’s wages.
* **2 Coin:** A fine weapon. A weekly income for a small business. A fine piece of art. A set of luxury clothes.
* **4 Coin:** A satchel full of silver. A month’s wages.
* **6 Coin:** An exquisite jewel. A heavy burden of silver pieces.
* **8 Coin:** A good monthly take for a small business. A small safe full of coins and valuables. A very rare luxury commodity.
* **10 coin:** Liquidating a significant asset, e.g. a carriage and mules, a horse, a deed to a small property.

More than 4 **coin** is an impractical amount to keep lying around. You must spend the excess or put it in your **stash** (see below). A party can also store 4 **coin** in their lair, by default. If they upgrade to a **vault**, they can expand their stores to 8 and then 16 **coin**. Any **coin** beyond their limit must be spent as soon as possible (typically before the next quest) or distributed among the party members.

One unit of **coin** in silver pieces or other bulk currency takes up one item slot for your **load** when carried.

## Coin Use

* Spend 1 **coin** to get an additional **activity** during **downtime**.
* Spend 1 **coin** to increase the result level of a **downtime activity** roll.
* Spend **coin** to avoid certain party **entanglements**.
* Put **coin** in your character’s **stash** to improve their lifestyle and circumstances when they retire.
* Spend **coin** when you advance your party’s **Tier**.
