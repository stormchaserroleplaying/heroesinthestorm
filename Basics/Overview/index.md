# Overview
Heroes in the Storm is a game powered by **Blades in the Dark** about a party of brave heroes venturing into the most dangerous corners of the land in search of gold and glory in a world of fantastic adventure. There's magic and gods, angels and demons, bloody skirmishes, deceptions, betrayals, victories, and deaths.

We play to find out if the adventuring party can thrive amidst the teeming threats of bandit gangs, warring noble families, dangerous monsters, strange mages, ruins of lost civilisations and each party member's own foibles and vices.
