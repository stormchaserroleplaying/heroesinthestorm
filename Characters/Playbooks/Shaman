# Shaman
Shamans commune with the spirits of nature and draw power from this relationship. They are typically fierce protectors of the natural world and can also use their mystic abilities to heal others.

## Special Abilities

### Bestial Form
You can tick your **ability clock** to take on the physical form of an animal of your choice that you are familiar with. For the duration of your transformation, you gain **potency** with one action associated with your choice of animal, as determined by the GM.

Only certain actions are viable choices for this ability based on the animal that you choose. You could shift into a hound to gain potency in **survey**, a charging bull to gain potency in **wreck**, a slinky housecat to **skulk** more effectively, or a nimble monkey in order to gain potency in **traverse**.

The transformation lasts until the end of the encounter unless you choose to end it sooner or you tick your ability clock again to choose a different form. The scale of the animal that you choose may be no greater than your tier.

### Dreamwalker
You know the mystic rituals required to enter the world of dreams while asleep or in trance. These rituals require at least an hour of preparation and may also require specific herbs and regents as determined by the GM.

When you enter your own dreams, you may encounter spirits, ancestors, or even the avatars of deities. You may attempt to **consort** with them to gain information or **sway** them to assist you in some way.

When you enter the dreams of another, you must **channel** in order to project your own spirit into their mind. Entering another’s dreams is easier if you are a trusted friend of the person, or if they are in close proximity to you while they sleep. While in another’s dreams, you gain **potency** when you attempt to sway them, **study** their mind to gain insight on their fears or desires, or **channel** to soothe them and relieve their stress.

Dangers of dreamwalking typically include encountering a person’s nightmares, which cannot kill you, but can harm your psyche.

You can tick your **ability clock** to bring others with you into the dream world. Each additional person that accompanies you requires you to tick you **ability clock** an additional time.

### Frondescence
You are adept at magically controlling plant life. Leaves unfurl at your touch, flowers bloom as you walk by and roots snake across the ground to clear your path.

You may add tick your **ability clock** to empower your control over plant life in one of the following ways:
* **Ensnaring Roots** - The ground becomes overgrown with tangled roots, making it difficult for anyone to move in the area and possibly restraining your foes.
* **Lashing Vines** - Thick ropes of thorn covered vines erupt from a location that you can see or grow from your arms like whips. These vines can be used as weapons to attack, or like grappling hooks to help you maneuver.
* **Abundant Growth** - You invest your magic into the ground or water at your feet, revitalising it. You could restore a burnt field of crops, rid a large tree of disease, or cleanse a poisoned well. You may increase the duration of this ability to equivalently increase the scale. E.g. spending a full day working your magic (duration 4) would expand its area of effect to that of a small building (area 4).

### Herbalist
When you gather herbs or craft a recipe with herbal reagents you may increase your result level by one step. You begin with one such special recipe already known.

### Protective Spirits
The spirits from which you draw your power defend you and your allies from harm. They might whirl around you as a protective shroud, or imbue an ally with the defensive qualities of bark or stone. You may tick to your **ability clock** to give yourself or an ally armour for the duration of an encounter. If you or the ally already has armour, this ability instead gives you heavy armour.

### Rapid Regeneration
You can make a **channel** fortune roll to cause the life-giving magic of nature to accelerate the natural healing capabilities of your and your allies’ bodies. 

A number of members of your party equal to the result of your roll may increase their result level by one step when taking the recover downtime action.

### Spore Cloud
You are host to a community of magical fungi, which sometimes sprout from your clothes and hair. A cloud of their spores surrounds you at all times. These spores fortify your lungs, allowing you to suffer **1 less stress** when you **resist** harm from airborne sources. Additionally, when you successfully damage a foe you may tick your **ability clock** to cause these spores to swirl out and leave your foe poisoned or dazed. This ability only works against creatures which need to breathe

### Voice of the Wild
Beasts, plants, and spirits of nature understand your speech and you can understand theirs. You gain **potency** when communicating with them.
