# Choose Abilities

## Assign Four Action Dots
Your playbook begins with three action dots already placed. You get to add four more dots (so you'll have seven total). At the start of the game, no action rating may have more than two dots (unless a special ability tells you otherwise). Brief descriptions of all the actions follow. Assign your four dots like this:
* Put one dot in any action that you feel reflects your character's **homeland**.
* Put one dot in any action that you feel reflects your character’s **background**.
* Assign two more dots anywhere you please (max rating is 2, remember).

## Choose A Special Ability
Take a look at the special abilities for your playbook and choose one. If you can’t decide which one to pick, go with the first one on the list. It’s placed there as a good default choice.

### Special Defence
Some special abilities refer to your special defence. Each character sheet has a box to track usage of special defence. If you have any abilities that use your special defence, tick its box when you activate one of them. If you don't have any special abilities that use special defence, then you can't use that box at all.
