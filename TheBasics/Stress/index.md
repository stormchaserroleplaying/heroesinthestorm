# Stress
Player characters in *Heroes in the Storm* have a special reserve of fortitude and luck called **stress**. When they suffer a consequence that they don't want to accept, they can take stress instead. The result of the **resistance roll** determines how much stress it costs to avoid a bad outcome.

> During a goblin ambush, Matt's character, Valaith, gets stabbed in the gut. Matt rolls his **Prowess** rating to resist, and gets a **2**. It costs 6 stress, minus 2 (the result of the resistance roll) to resist the consequences. Matt marks off 4 stress and describes how Valaith survives.
> 
> The GM rules that the harm is reduced by the resistance roll, but not avoided entirely. Valaith suffers level 2 harm (“Gut Wound”) instead of level 3 harm (“Organ Damage”).
