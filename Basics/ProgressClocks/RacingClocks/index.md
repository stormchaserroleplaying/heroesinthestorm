# Racing Clocks
Create two opposed clocks to represent a race. The evil wizard pulling the strings of a tribe of kobolds might have a progress clock called "Escape" while the PCs have a clock called "Cornered". If the wizard finishes their clock before the PCs fill theirs, they get away. Otherwise, they're cornered and can't flee. If both complete at the same time, the wizards escapes to their lair, but the hunting PCs are outside!

You can also use racing clocks for an environmental hazard. Maybe the PCs are trying to complete the "Search" clock to find the lockbox on the sinking ship before the GM fills the "Sunk" clock and the vessel goes down.
