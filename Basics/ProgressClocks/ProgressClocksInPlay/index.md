# Progress Clocks In Play

## Infiltrating Haus Sternental

*The adventurers are sneaking into Lord Morgenstern's house to steal a book in which he keeps secret maps of trade routes across the frozen equator (worth a small fortune to the right buyer). The GM makes a progress clock for the alert level of Morgenstern’s personal staff and bodyguards. They make a 4-clock because it’s a single house, not a sprawling estate. Only a few suspicious events will rouse the whole place. During the operation, Caio rolls to **Skulk** through the first floor and rolls a 4/5. He gets past, but the complication is a tick on the "Alert" clock. The GM ticks it once to represent the threat level of the kitchen staff downstairs. They’re not trained security, so limited effect is called for. Later, when Ling rolls a 1-3 on a desperate action to sneak into Morgenstern’s private suite, the GM fills three segments. The Lord’s bodyguards are Tier IV professionals and are experts at spotting trouble. This fills the clock! When Ling eases the door open, she’s set upon by the first pair of bodyguards, while the other two escort Morgenstern (and his precious book!) out the back way.*

## Assaulting the Morrigan

*The adventurers attack the fortress of the Morrigan, in a final showdown to see which group will survive to control the flow of trade in the Ice Cap Peaks. The GM makes a clock for the forces of each faction. As the PCs take actions and suffer consequences, the GM ticks the clocks to show the waning strength and morale of each side. When one side's clock is filled, they've reached a breaking point. Will they flee, surrender, or fall into a suicidal rage?*
