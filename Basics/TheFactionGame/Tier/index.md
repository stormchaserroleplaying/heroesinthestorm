# Tier
Each notable faction is ranked by **Tier** — a measure of wealth, influence and scale. At the highest level are the Tier V and VI factions, the true powers of the world. Your party begins at Tier 0.

You'll use your Tier rating to roll dice when you acquire an asset, as well as for any fortune roll for which your party’s overall power level and influence is the primary trait. Most importantly, your Tier determines the **quality level** of your items as well as the quality and **scale** of the units your party employs and thereby what size of enemy you can expect to handle.

###### Unit Scale By Tier

| Tier | Unit Size |
|-----:|----------:|
| V | Massive (80 People) |
| IV | Huge (40 People) |
| III | Large (20 People) |
| II | Medium (12 People) |
| I | Small (3-6 People) |
| 0 | Tiny (1-2 People) |

A given unit might have no units, one unit, or many units.
