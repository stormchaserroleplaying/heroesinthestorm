# PC vs. PC

Situations may arise in play in which two or more PCs come into conflict. How do you deal with this? In general, the rules for PC vs. PC action are the same as the rules for PC vs. NPC action. It’s still action rolls, resistance rolls, fortune rolls; effects and consequences; and resolution into a new situation. But it’s a good idea to follow some guidelines when it comes to PC vs. PC conflict.

1. **Pause the game.** When a PC comes into conflict with another PC, pause the game. It’s a time-out in the fictional space, while the players talk things through. Don’t be in a big rush to roll dice. Slow everything way down. This isn’t a "who talks first wins" situation (and especially not "who talks more or loudest").

> *"Who goes first?" is sometimes the question players fixate on, especially if things are about to get violent. Usually, the answer is clear from the situation: someone has the initiative and someone else is reacting. If it isn’t clear, you can make fortune rolls. Each player rolls an action rating and you compare the results.*

2. **Agree to the resolution methods.** Talk it through, figure out the rolls, and discuss the consequences at stake. Don't try to resolve the situation until everyone agrees to the methods you're about to use. If you have an objection or an alternate idea, speak up! If the players can’t agree to a method, then you're deadlocked. You can’t proceed without everyone’s consent, so this conflict just isn't going to happen. Maybe the PCs get in each other’s faces and act like they're going to tangle, but then, nope... it fizzles and they back off. This happens in fiction a lot, and it’s okay if it happens in the game.

> *It’s a good idea to ask each other questions to help establish the resolution, rather than trying to impose your will. You might ask, "Can Val be Swayed here? What would it take?" or, "Is Jex within reach if I draw my maul now and attack?" or, "How vicious is Caio going to be? Do you really want to hurt me?"*

3. **Abide by the results.** Once you've agreed to the methods, then follow them through and abide by the outcomes. You can roll resistance to avoid bad results, as usual, so don’t try to weasel out of it some other way if things don’t turn out the way you hoped.

Note that this is not a "player vs. player" system. When characters come into conflict, the players must still collaborate and make judgment calls together, as usual. Conflicts between players are outside the scope of the game; they can’t be resolved with the dice rolls and mechanics of *Heroes in the Storm*. If the players (not their characters) are in conflict, you'll have to work it out using social methods, then return to the game when it’s resolved. Don't try to use the game as a way to dodge or replace a normal social interaction to resolve person-to-person conflict.
