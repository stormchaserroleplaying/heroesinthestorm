# Tug-of-War Clocks
You can make a clock that can be filled and emptied by events, to represent a back-and-forth situation. You might make a "Revolution!" clock that indicates when the slum-dwellers of Bednik start to riot over poor treatment in Piotrgrad. Some events will tick the clock up and some will tick it down. Once it fills, the revolution begins. A tug-of-war clock is also perfect for an ongoing turf war between two factions.
