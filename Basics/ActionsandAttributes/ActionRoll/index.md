# Action Roll
You make an **action roll** when your character does something potentially dangerous or troublesome. The possible results of the action roll depend on your character's **position**. There are three positions: **controlled**, **risky**, and **desperate**. If you're in a **controlled** position, the possible consequences are less serious. If you're in a **desperate** position, the consequences can be severe. If you're somewhere in between, itâ€™s **risky**, which is usually considered the "default" position for
most actions.

If there's no danger or trouble at hand, you don't make an action roll. You might make a **fortune** roll, or a **downtime** roll, or the GM will simply say yes and you accomplish your goal.
