# Character Creation
Every player character in *Heroes in the Storm* is a daring adventurer, seeking their destiny in the world of Arden. All of them are familiar with the feats represented by the actions of the game. They're all able to **Skirmish** in melee, **Skulk** in the shadows, **Channel** strange energy, **Consort** with contacts for information, and so on.

Because of the way the dice system works, every adventurer can roll at least 2d for any action in the game (+1d from pushing or a Devil’s Bargain, and a +1d assist from a teammate). A roll of 2d is pretty good, statistically. A 75% chance of success. This means that all of the "zero rating" actions on your character sheet don't actually represent deficiencies or gaps of skill; they indicate the actions for which your character is likely to burn stress and rely on teamwork. When your party has your back and you set your mind to it, you can attempt almost anything.

Of course, you'll also have particular talents. You may want to be able to bend magic to your will and observe things far beyond your senses, or perhaps you want to be the most skilled swordsman in the country. In this chapter, you'll learn how to create your own unique character and choose the abilities that suit the style of play you prefer.

## Character Creation Summary
1. **Choose a playbook.** Your playbook represents your character’s reputation, their special abilities, and how they advance.

2. **Choose a species.** Your species grants you its own unique abilities.

3. **Choose a homeland.** Detail your choice with a note about your family life. For example, *Breanne: farmers, now war refugees in Quenlan*.
 
4. **Choose a background.** Detail your choice with your specific history. For example, *Labour: sailor, mutineer*.

5. **Assign four action dots.** No action may begin with a rating higher than 2 during character creation. (After creation, action ratings may advance up to 4.)

6. **Choose a special ability.** They're in the gray column in the middle of the character sheet. If you can’t decide, choose the first ability on the list. It’s placed there as a good first option.
 
7. **Choose a close friend and a rival.** Mark the one who is a close friend, long-time ally, family relation, or lover (the upward-pointingtriangle). Mark one who is a rival, enemy, scorned lover, betrayed partner, etc. (the downward-pointing triangle).

8. **Choose your respite.** Pick your preferred type of respite and detail it with a short description.

9. **Record your name, alias, and look.** Choose a name, an alias (if you use one), and jot down a few words to describe your look.
