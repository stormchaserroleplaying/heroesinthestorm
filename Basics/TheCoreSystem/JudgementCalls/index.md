# Judgement Calls
Since roleplaying is a collaborative, expressive act, not a purely strategic endeavor, you'll need to make judgment calls. By making these choices, the game group together establishes a style, tone, and form of fiction unique to their instance of play. *Heroes in the Storm* is designed to bring these judgment calls to the forefront and make them explicit tools of the game.

When you play, you'll make several key judgment calls. Everyone contributes, but either the players or the GM gets final say for each:

* Which actions are reasonable as a solution to a problem? *Can this person be swayed? Must we get out the tools and tinker with this old rusty lock, or could it also be quietly finessed?* The players have the final say.
* How dangerous and how effective is a given action in this circumstance? *How risky is this? Can this person be swayed very little or a whole lot?* The GM has the final say.
* Which consequences are inflicted to manifest the dangers in a given circumstance? *Does this fall from the roof break your leg? Do the orcs merely become suspicious or do they already have you trapped?* The GM has the final say.
* Does this situation call for a dice roll, and which one? *Is your adventurer in position to make an action roll or must they first make a resistance roll to gain initiative?* The GM has the final say.
* Which events in the story match the experience triggers for character and party advancement? *Did you express your character’s beliefs, drives, heritage, or background? You tell us.* The players have the final say. 

The particular choices you make will create your own unique form of *Heroes in the Storm*. You'll say something about the world, the characters and life in general. What will you say? There’s only one way to find out.
