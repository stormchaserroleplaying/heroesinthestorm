# The Players
Each player creates a character and works with the other players to create the party to which their characters belong. Each player strives to bring their character to life as an interesting, daring adventurer, who reaches boldly beyond their current safety and means. **This is the players' core responsibility:** they engage with the premise of the game, seeking out interesting opportunities for adventure in Arden, taking big risks against powerful foes and sending their characters into danger.

The players work together with the Game Master to establish the tone and style of the game by making judgment calls about the mechanics, dice, and consequences of actions. The players take responsibility as co-authors of the game with the GM. For more, see **Players Best Practices**.
