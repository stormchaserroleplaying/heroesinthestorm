# Demonic Lineage
The unspeakable power and corruption of the Abyss found its way into your bloodline, granting you grotesque and demonic abilities. Demonics exist only to corrupt, bespoil, and destroy, a virus within the body of life itself. Their abilities are greatly feared, and their only law is strength. Such terrible chaos now calls out to you.

## Special Abilities

### Demonic Arsenal
You can manifest claws (treated as blades) as well as scales, chitin, or other inhuman defensive features (treated as armour). If you already have armour, gain heavy armour.

### Spontaneous Mutation
Your physiology resonates with the seed of chaos that lies within your soul, allowing you to warp and alter your body with ease. Take +1d whenever you Channel in order to shift your form, alter your appearance, or manifest new bodily adaptations

### Caustic Blood
When you suffer harm after an enemy has physically attacked you, you may tick your Ability Clock to make a Skirmish Chance roll as your volatile blood sprays out at them from your wound.

### Horrific Transformation
You tick your Ability Clock twice to allow the undefinable power of the Abyss to spread unchecked through your body. You develop two of the listed traits, and may push yourself or take a Devilâ€™s Bargain for more. 
Serrated claws capable of scaling walls and ceilings.
Your form grows to twice its normal size.
Your bones warp into flexible cartilage that allows for greater mobility and damage resistance.
Many eyes cover the upper portion of your face, allowing enhanced sight able to pierce magical influence and illusion.

### Sanguine Plague
Large serpents or insects spring forth from any surface touched by your blood. These creatures are poisonous and aggressive towards anyone whom you wish harm.
The number of creatures generated is dependent on the level of harm inflicted. Level 1 Blood Loss produces 2 creatures, Level 2 produces 3, ect.

### Blood Rush
Your body responds to violence like a stimulant. When you successfully attack a new target for the first time, you may tick your Ability Clock to relieve 1 stress.
